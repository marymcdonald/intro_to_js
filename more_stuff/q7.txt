My answer: Exception handling is dealing with expected edge cases that will throw errors. Preemptively dealing with expected errors ensures that code runs as intended, instead of stopping or silently failing.

Solution: Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
